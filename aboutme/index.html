    <h2>Karla Morga</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Karla!I am currently a software engineering major. I honestly really love it and
        think that it's a lot of fun. I'm from North Georgia, so being in Rexburg is a little different for me, especially with the weather!!
        I have experienced more snow in a couple months in Idaho than I have in years being on the East Coast. </p>

        <p>Some things that I love to do is listen to music, watch movies, and play and watch sports. I really love playing
        softball recreationally. I also really love doing fun fall things in Rexburg, especially all of the haunted things
        such as the Haunted Hospital and the Haunted River. </p>

        <p>I am actually a convert into the Church so being here in Idaho has been a really different experience for me. 
        I got baptized when I was 16, and just recently got endowed. My life has changed a lot and I have had so many blessings from 
        learning more and striving more to live like Christ. </p>
